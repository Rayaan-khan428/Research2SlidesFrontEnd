ABSTRACT\nIt is claimed that artificial intelligence is playing an increasing role in research areas.\nAt present many intelligent machines are replaced or enhanced human capabilities in\nmany areas. Artificial Intelligence is the exhibited by machines or software. It has the\nadvantages over the natural intelligence as it is more permanent, consistent, less\nexpensive, has the ease of duplication and dissemination, can be documented and can\nperform certain tasks much faster and better than the human. Its scientific goal is to\nunderstand intelligence by building computer programs that exhibit intelligent\nbehaviour.\nThis paper presents some back ground and potential of artificial intelligence and its\nimplementation in various fields. We discuss issues that have not been studied in\ndetail with in the expert systems setting, yet are crucial for developing theoretical\nmethods and computational architectures for automated reasons. The tools that are\nrequired to construct expert systems are discussed in detail.\nKEY WORDS: Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms, Cognitive computing,\nClustering, Decision tree, Fluent, Machine intelligence, CNN, Logic\nprogramming.\n***END OF PAGE 2***\n\n***START OF PAGE 3***\n1. INTRODUCTION\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a science and a set of computational technologies that\nare inspired by—but typically operate quite differently from—the ways people use\ntheir nervous systems and bodies to sense, learn, reason, and take action. While\nconcepts already date back more than fifty years, only recently have technological\nadvances enabled successful implementation at industrial scale.\nEarlier in nientin50 artificial intelligence success were limited to the scientific field\nbut in the last years, established IT giants like Google, IBM and Nvidia – fuelled by\nthe abundance of data, algorithmic advances, and the usages of high performance\nhardware for parallel processing have been bridging the gap between science and\nbusiness applications.\nThe research is designed to address three intended audiences. For the general public,\nit aims to provide an accessible, scientifically and technologically accurate portrayal\nof the current state of AI and its potential. For industry, the report describes relevant\ntechnologies and legal and ethical challenges, and may help guide resource allocation.\nThe report is also directed to local, national, and international governments to help\nthem better plan for AI in governance.\n2. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?\nDEFINITION\nCuriously, the lack of a precise, universally accepted definition of AI probably has\nhelped the field to grow, blossom, and advance at an ever-accelerating pace.\nPractitioners, researchers, and developers of AI are instead guided by a rough sense of\ndirection and an imperative to “get on with it.” Still, a definition remains important\nand Nils J. Nilsson has provided a useful one:\n“Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and\nintelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with\nforesight in its environment.” From this perspective, characterizing AI depends on the\ncredit one is willing to give synthesized software and hardware for functioning\n“appropriately” and with “foresight.” A simple electronic calculator performs\ncalculations much faster than the human brain, and almost never makes a mistake.\n***END OF PAGE 3***\n\n***START OF PAGE 4***\n3. APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN VARIOUS\nFIELDS\n1. TRANSPORTATION\nTransportation is likely to be one of the first domains in which the general public will\nbe asked to trust the reliability and safety of an AI system for a critical task.\nAutonomous transportation will soon be commonplace and, as most people’s first\nexperience with physically embodied AI systems, will strongly influence the public’s\nperception of AI. Once the physical hardware is made sufficiently safe and robust, its\nintroduction to daily life may happen so suddenly as to surprise the public, which will\nrequire time to adjust. As cars will become better drivers than people, city-dwellers\nwill own fewer cars, live further from work, and spend time differently, leading to an\nentirely new urban organization. Further, in the typical North American city in twenty\nthirties, changes won’t be limited to cars and trucks, but are likely to include flying\nvehicles and personal robots, and will raise social, ethical and policy issues. A few\nkey technologies have already catalysed the widespread adoption of AI in\ntransportation. Compared to 2 thousands, the scale and diversity of data about\npersonal and population-level transportation available today—enabled by the adoption\nof smartphones and decreased costs and improved accuracies for variety of sensors—\nis astounding. Without the availability of this data and connectivity, applications such\nas real-time sensing and prediction of traffic, route calculations, peer-to-peer\nridesharing and self-driving cars would not be possible.\nFOR EXAMPLE: smart cars, self-driving vehicles, on demand transportation, etc.\n4. HOME/SERVICE ROBOTS\nRobots have entered people’s homes in the past fifteen years. Disappointingly slow\ngrowth in the diversity of applications has occurred simultaneously with increasingly\nsophisticated AI deployed on existing applications. AI advances are often inspired by\nmechanical innovations, which in turn prompt new AI techniques to be introduced.\nOver the next fifteen years, coincident advances in mechanical and AI technologies\n***END OF PAGE 4***\n\n***START OF PAGE 5***\npromise to increase the safe and reliable use and utility of home robots in a typical\nNorth American city. Special purpose robots will deliver packages, clean offices, and\nenhance security, but technical constraints and the high costs of reliable mechanical\ndevices will continue to limit commercial opportunities to narrowly defined\napplications for the foreseeable future. As with self-driving cars and other new\ntransportation machines, the difficulty of creating reliable, market-ready hardware is\nnot to be underestimated.\nFOR EXAMPLE: Vacuum cleaners, home robots twenty thirthy, etc.\n5. HEALTHCARE\nFor AI technologies, healthcare has long been viewed as a promising domain. AI-\nbased applications could improve health outcomes and quality of life for millions of\npeople in the coming years—but only if they gain the trust of doctors, nurses, and\npatients, and if policy, regulatory, and commercial obstacles are removed. Prime\napplications include clinical decision support, patient monitoring and coaching,\nautomated devices to assist in surgery or patient care, and management of healthcare\nsystems. Recent successes, such as mining social media to infer possible health risks,\nmachine learning to predict patients at risk, and robotics to support surgery, have\nexpanded a sense of possibility for AI in healthcare. Improvements in methods for\ninteracting with medical professionals and patients will be a critical challenge. As in\nother domains, data is a key enabler. There has been an immense forward leap in\ncollecting useful data from personal monitoring devices and mobile apps, from\nelectronic health records (EHR) in clinical settings and, to a lesser extent, from robots\ndesigned to assist with medical procedures and hospital operations. But using this data\nto enable more finely-grained diagnostics and treatments for both individual patients\nand patient populations has proved difficult. Research and deployment have been\nslowed by outdated regulations and incentive structures. Poor human-computer\ninteraction methods and the inherent difficulties and risks of implementing\ntechnologies in such a large and complex system have slowed realization of AI’s\npromise in healthcare The reduction or removal of these obstacles, combined with\ninnovations still on the horizon, have the potential to significantly improve health\noutcomes and quality of life for millions of people in the coming years.\n***END OF PAGE 5***\n\n***START OF PAGE 6***\nFOR EXAMPLE: The clinical setting, healthcare analytics, healthcare robotics,\nmobile health, elder care, etc.\n6. EDUCATION\nThe past fifteen years have seen considerable AI advances in education. Applications\nare in wide use by educators and learners today, with some variation between K-\ntwelve and university settings. Though quality education will always require active\nengagement by human teachers, AI promises to enhance education at all levels,\nespecially by providing personalization at scale. Similar to healthcare, resolving how\nto best integrate human interaction and face-to-face learning with promising AI\ntechnologies remains a key challenge. Robots have long been popular educational\ndevices, starting with the early Lego Mind storms kits developed with the MIT Media\nLab in the nineteen eighties. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) for science, math,\nlanguage, and other disciplines match students with interactive machine tutors.\nNatural Language Processing, especially when combined with machine learning and\ncrowdsourcing, has boosted online learning and enabled teachers to multiply the size\nof their classrooms while simultaneously addressing individual students’ learning\nneeds and styles. The data sets from large online learning systems have fuelled rapid\ngrowth in learning analytics. Still, schools and universities have been slow in adopting\nAI technologies primarily due to lack of funds and lack of solid evidence that they\nhelp students achieve learning objectives. Over the next fifteen years in a typical\nNorth American city, the use of intelligent tutors and other AI technologies to assist\nteachers in the classroom and in the home is likely to expand significantly, as will\nlearning based on virtual reality applications. But computer-based learning systems\nare not likely to fully replace human teaching in schools.\n7. PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY\nCities already have begun to deploy AI technologies for public safety and security.\nBy two thousand and thirthy, the typical North American city will rely heavily upon\nthem. These include cameras for surveillance that can detect anomalies pointing to a\npossible crime, drones, and predictive policing applications. As with most issues,\n***END OF PAGE 6***\n\n***START OF PAGE 7***\nthere are benefits and risks. Gaining public trust is crucial. While there are legitimate\nconcerns that policing that incorporates AI may become overbearing or pervasive in\nsome contexts, the opposite is also possible. AI may enable policing to become more\ntargeted and used only when needed. And assuming careful deployment, AI may also\nhelp remove some of the bias inherent in human decision-making. One of the more\nsuccessful uses of AI analytics is in detecting white collar crime, such as credit card\nfraud. Cyber security (including spam) is a widely shared concern, and machine\nlearning is making an impact. AI tools may also prove useful in helping police\nmanage crime scenes or search and rescue events by helping commanders prioritize\ntasks and allocate resources, though these tools are not yet ready for automating such\nactivities. Improvements in machine learning in general, and transfer learning in\nparticular—for speeding up learning in new scenarios based on similarities with past\nscenarios—may facilitate such systems. The cameras deployed almost everywhere in\nthe world today tend to be more useful for helping solve crimes than preventing them\nThis is due to the low quality of event identification from videos and the lack of\nmanpower to look at massive video streams. As AI for this domain improves, it will\nbetter assist crime prevention and prosecution through greater accuracy of event\nclassification and efficient automatic processing of video to detect anomalies—\nincluding, potentially, evidence of police malpractice. These improvements could lead\nto even more widespread surveillance. Some cities have already added drones for\nsurveillance purposes, and police use of drones to maintain security of ports, airports,\ncoastal areas, waterways, and industrial facilities is likely to increase, raising concerns\nabout privacy, safety, and other issues.\n8. EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE\nWhile AI technologies are likely to have a profound future impact on employment\nand workplace trends in a typical North American city, it is difficult to accurately\nassess current impacts, positive or negative. In the past fifteen years, employment has\nshifted due to a major recession and increasing globalization, particularly with\nChina’s introduction to the world economy, as well as enormous changes in non-AI\ndigital technology. Since the nineteen nineties, the US has experienced continued\ngrowth in productivity and GDP, but median income has stagnated and the\n***END OF PAGE 7***\n\n***START OF PAGE 8***\nemployment to population ratio has fallen. There are clear examples of industries in\nwhich digital technologies have had profound impacts, good and bad, and other\nsectors in which automation will likely make major changes in the near future. Many\nof these changes have been driven strongly by “routine” digital technologies,\nincluding enterprise resource planning, networking, information processing, and\nsearch. Understanding these changes should provide insights into how AI will affect\nfuture labour demand, including the shift in skill demands. To date, digital\ntechnologies have been affecting workers more in the skilled middle, such as travel\nagents, rather than the very lowest-skilled or highest skilled work. On the other hand,\nthe spectrum of tasks that digital systems can do is evolving as AI systems improve,\nwhich is likely to gradually increase the scope of what is considered routine. AI is\nalso creeping into high end of the spectrum, including professional services not\nhistorically performed by machines. To be successful, AI innovations will need to\novercome understandable human fears of being marginalized. AI will likely replace\ntasks rather than jobs in the near term, and will also create new kinds of jobs. But the\nnew jobs that will emerge are harder to imagine in advance than the existing jobs that\nwill likely be lost. Changes in employment usually happen gradually, often without a\nsharp transition, a trend likely to continue as AI slowly moves into the workplace. A\nspectrum of effects will emerge, ranging from small amounts of replacement or\naugmentation to complete replacement. For example, although most of a lawyer’s job\nis not yet automated, AI applied to legal information extraction and topic modelling\nhas automated parts of first-year lawyers’ jobs. In the not too distant future, a diverse\narray of job-holders, from radiologists to truck drivers to gardeners, may be affected.\nAI may also influence the size and location of the workforce. Many organizations and\ninstitutions are large because they perform functions that can be scaled only by adding\nhuman labour, either “horizontally” across geographical areas or “vertically” in\nmanagement hierarchies. As AI takes over many functions, scalability no longer\nimplies large organizations. Many have noted the small number of employees of some\nhigh profile internet companies, but not of others. There may be a natural scale of\nhuman enterprise, perhaps where the CEO can know everyone in the company.\nThrough the creation of efficiently outsourced labour markets enabled by AI,\nenterprises may tend towards that natural size. AI will also create jobs, especially in\nsome sectors, by making certain tasks more important, and create new categories of\nemployment by making new modes of interaction possible.\n***END OF PAGE 8***\n\n***START OF PAGE 9***\n9. ENTERTAINMENT\nWith the explosive growth of the internet over the past fifteen years, few can imagine\ntheir daily lives without it. Powered by AI, the internet has established user-generated\ncontent as a viable source of information and entertainment. Social networks such as\nFacebook are now pervasive, and they function as personalized channels of social\ninteraction and entertainment—sometimes to the detriment of interpersonal\ninteraction. Apps such as WhatsApp and Snap chat enable smart-phone users to\nremain constantly “in touch” with peers and share sources of entertainment and\ninformation. In on-line communities such as Second Life and role-playing games such\nas World of War craft, people imagine an alternative existence in a virtual world.\nSpecialized devices, such as Amazon’s Kindle have also redefined the essentials of\nlong-cherished pastimes. Books can now be browsed and procured with a few swipes\nof the finger, stored by the thousands in a pocket-sized device, and read in much the\nsame way as a handheld paperback. Trusted platforms now exist for sharing and\nbrowsing blogs, videos, photos, and topical discussions, in addition to a variety of\nother user-generated information. To operate at the scale of the internet, these\nplatforms must rely on techniques that are being actively developed in natural\nlanguage processing, information retrieval, image processing, crowdsourcing, and\nmachine learning. Algorithms such as collaborative filtering have been developed, for\nexample, to recommend relevant movies, songs, or articles based on the user’s\ndemographic details and browsing history. Traditional sources of entertainment have\nalso embraced AI to keep pace with the times. As exemplified in the book and movie\nMoney ball, professional sport is now subjected to intensive quantitative analysis.\nBeyond aggregate performance statistics, on-field signals can be monitored using\nsophisticated sensors and cameras. Software has been created for composing music\nand recognizing soundtracks. Techniques from computer vision and NLP have been\nused in creating stage performances. Even the lay user can exercise his or her\ncreativity on platforms such as Words Eye, which automatically generates 3D scenes\nfrom natural language text. AI has also come to the aid of historical research in the\narts, and is used extensively in stylometry and, more recently, in the analysis of\npaintings. The enthusiasm with which humans have responded to AI-driven\nentertainment has been surprising and led to concerns that it reduces interpersonal\n***END OF PAGE 9***\n\n***START OF PAGE 10***\ninteraction among human beings. Few predicted that people would spend hours on\nend interacting with a display. Children often appear to be genuinely happier playing\nat home on their devices rather than outside with their friends. AI will increasingly\nenable entertainment that is more interactive, personalized, and engaging. Research\nshould be directed toward understanding how to leverage these attributes for\nindividuals’ and society’s benefit.\n10. FINANCE AND ECONOMICS\nFinancial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect\ncharges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The\nuse of AI in banking can be traced back to early nineties when Security Pacific\nNational Bank in US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorised\nuse of debit cards. Programs like Kasisto and Money stream are using AI in financial\nservices.\nBanks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations, maintain book-\nkeeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes overnight or\nwhen business is not taking place. In August twenty-first century, robots beat humans in a\nsimulated financial trading competition. AI has also reduced fraud and financial\ncrimes by monitoring behavioural patterns of users for any abnormal changes or\nanomalies.\nThe use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and\ndecision making has changed major economic theories. For example, AI based buying\nand selling platforms have changed the law of supply and demand in that it is now\npossible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus\nindividualized pricing. Furthermore, AI machines reduce information asymmetry in\nthe market and thus making markets more efficient while reducing the volume of\ntrades. Furthermore, AI in the markets limits the consequences of behaviour in the\nmarkets again making markets more efficient. Other theories where AI has had impact\ninclude in rational choice, rational expectations, game theory, Lewis turning\npoint, portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking.\n***END OF PAGE 10***\n\n***START OF PAGE 11***\n11. VIDEO GAMES\nIn video games, artificial intelligence is routinely used to generate dynamic\npurposeful behaviour in non-player characters (NPCs). In addition, well-understood\nAI techniques are routinely used for path finding. Some researchers consider NPC AI\nin games to be a \"solved problem\" for most production tasks. Games with more\natypical AI include the AI director of Left 4 Dead and the neuro-evolutionary training\nof platoons in games.\n12.  AFTERMATH\n13. BENEFITS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nCompanies new to the space can learn a great deal from early adopters who have invested\nbillions into AI and are now beginning to reap a range of benefits.\nAfter decades of extravagant promises and frustrating disappointments, artificial\nintelligence (AI) is finally starting to deliver real-life benefits to early-adopting companies.\nRetailers on the digital frontier rely on AI-powered robots to run their warehouses—and\neven to automatically order stock when inventory runs low. Utilities use AI to forecast\nelectricity demand. Automakers harness the technology in self-driving cars.\nA confluence of developments is driving this new wave of AI development. Computer\npower is growing, algorithms and AI models are becoming more sophisticated, and,\nperhaps most important of all, the world is generating once-unimaginable volumes of the\nfuel that powers AI—data. Billions of gigabytes every day, collected by networked\ndevices ranging from web browsers to turbine sensors.\nThe entrepreneurial activity unleashed by these developments drew three times as much\ninvestment in twenty sixteen—between $twenty billion and $forty billion—as it did three\nyears earlier. Most of the investment in AI consists of internal R&D spending by large,\ncash-rich digital-native companies like Amazon, Baidu, and Google.\n***END OF PAGE 11***\n\n***START OF PAGE 12***\nHowever, early evidence suggests that there is a business case to be made, and that AI can\ndeliver real value to companies willing to use it across operations and within their core\nfunctions.\n• A company program with artificial intelligence can answer the generic question it\nis meant to solve.\n• Artificial intelligence can absorb new modifications by putting highly independent\npieces of even a minute piece of information of programme without affecting its\nstructure.\n• Quick and easy modification of programmes.\nThe statistic shows the growth of the artificial intelligence market worldwide, the\nglobal AI market is expected to grow approximately one hundred and seventy five%\nfrom prior levels, reaching an forecast size of two point four billion U.S. dollars.\nArtificial intelligence is a term used to describe a variety of technologies. These\ninclude machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and\n***END OF PAGE 12***\n\n***START OF PAGE 13***\nmachine reasoning, among others. Artificial intelligence is expected to have\nimplications for and a use in every industry vertical, and is likely to be one of the next\ngreat technological shifts, like the advent of the computer age or the smartphone\nrevolution.\n14. HOW CAN AI BE DANGEROUS?\nMost researchers agree that a super intelligent AI is unlikely to exhibit human\nemotions like love or hate, and that there is no reason to expect AI to become\nintentionally benevolent or malevolent. Instead, when considering how AI\nmight become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely:\n• The AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons\nare artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of\nthe wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties.\nMoreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also\nresults in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these\nweapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply “turn off,” so\nhumans could plausibly lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that’s\npresent even with narrow AI, but grows as levels of AI intelligence and\nautonomy increase.\n• The AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a\ndestructive method for achieving its goal: This can happen whenever we fail\nto fully align the AI’s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask\nan obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it\nmight get you there chased by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing not\nwhat you wanted but literally what you asked for. If a super intelligent system\nis tasked with a ambitious geo-engineering project, it might wreak havoc with\nour ecosystem as a side effect, and view human attempts to stop it as a threat\nto be met.\nAs these examples illustrate, the concern about advanced AI isn’t malevolence but\ncompetence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals,\nand if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we have a problem. You’re probably not\n***END OF PAGE 13***\n\n***START OF PAGE 14***\nan evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you’re in charge of a\nhydroelectric green energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded,\ntoo bad for the ants. A key goal of AI safety research is to never place humanity in the\nposition of those ants.\n15. CONCLUSION\nArtificial intelligence exhibited by machines, with machines mimicking function\ntypically associated with human cognition. Artificial intelligence functions include all\naspects of perception, learning, knowledge representation, reasoning, planning and\ndecision making. The ability of these function to adapt to new context i.e., situations\nthat an artificial intelligence system was not previously trained to deal with, is one\naspect that differentiates strong artificial intelligence from weak artificial intelligence.\n***END OF PAGE 14***\n\n"
